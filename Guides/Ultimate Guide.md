So, after reading many good posts and comments from Neet students and achievers, I finally arrive at the ultimate study guide and tips for my Neetard homies. 

1. Consistency is the key to cracking this exam. 
2. NCERT is the bible for Biology and IOC. 
3. Neet exam has become a rattification exam and conceptual thinking is dead. So improve your memorising skills.
4. Develop a habit of reading NCert everyday whenever you get time.
5. Do not think too much about your coaching tests marks but keep on improving the scores.
6. Set a target for at least 640 next year as the paper demands extreme high accuracy with 100% syllabus in our hands of perfection
7. Syllabus completion is must. A medium-good grasp of all chapters will prove fruitful.
8. Make your own notes. PDFs, modules and somebody else's notes dont work for many. 
9. Attend Lectures/Videos of Each Chapter and optionally make notes from them. Choose any good Teacher You want; It doesn't matter. However, don't waste time sitting and making notes seperately.
10. Solve 100-250 Questions per chapter depending upon the size of the chapter. Mark and analyse the difficult/ incorrectly solved Questions
11. Revision is the only saver. Revise as much as you can every week.
12. Complete the syllabus on time. If your coaching is running late, we ball to self-study or online lecs. 
13. Either start early to remain ahead of others like complete half/full chapter before the coaching teaches you or be fully attentive to the present.
14. For God's sake, use the doubt centres daily or interact with your teachers to know strategies or even share your problems.
15. Solve Pyqs and extra MCQS like crazy. 
16. Cut off / minimize social media and toxic friends. Keep in touch with a few friends and parents to keep you mentally sane. 
17. A timetable and a plan with a disciplined you is all that's required.
18. Donot waste time in material hunting 
19. Make a mistake notebook to track in your mistakes in tests, pyqs, etc. 
20. Sleeping less is not cool, drinking 5 cups of coffee a day is not cool, you are sabotaging yourself by doing these things.
21. Time management : Allot equal times to each subject and a bit more to the weaker ones.
22. A backup plan/exam can prove helpful to ease off the load but NEET should be the priority.
23. Coaching: An average student is advised to join a good institute but online platforms are good too. Just self-belief and daily execution is required. Hai himmat hardin book kholne ka ghar pe?
24. Your MEDIOCRITY can be boosted if you give fcukton of tests. 
25. NEET isn't an exam for selection but rather elimination


**SUBJECT WISE TIPS**

**BIOLOGY**

- NCERT biology is be-all and end-all. Revise 1-2 ncert chapters everyday all these last months. Every line is important, try to read between the lines as well, what is implied, what is it referencing.

**PHYSICS**
- Physics in NEET ain't that hard tbh. So, donot try solving hard books. Rather focus on the coaching modules or good books. 
- Electrostatics, Modern Physics requires NCERT reading. Just look up past year papers and see what are the chapters they give statement or AR type questions from, reading theory is must.
- Write down and memorise the formulas dil se. Also, understand the concept first and then apply/mug up. 
- Don't go too deep into Physics concepts as the exam doesn't demand that at all.

**CHEMISTRY**
- Read NCERT for IOC 
- Make proper notes of all reactions of OC
- Practise a sufficient amount of numericals for physical chem . Play it smart
